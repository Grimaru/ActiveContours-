#### My own side project for Computer Vision subject (the main one is actually in my friend’s Github account. The same model but I did the detection while he did the full project for the subject)

#### I just tried to make the Active Contours – Snakes can be dynamic as many researchs show that Active Contours can work with static image, not video (dynamic). However, due to my teacher’s support, I can make it a little bit more responsive to the shape but making it shrink is still a difficult process. 
#### However, due to my lack of time as for the 2nd semester is coming too soon (mostly a semester in the university equals three months and we have a break for about almost a month, I guess. 2nd semester coming that I have to learn new subjects, though)
#### In the future, I will remake it if I have time.
